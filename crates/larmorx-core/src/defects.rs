//! Upstream defects: D13, "correct by default, faithful on request" (`docs/api/upstream-defects.md`).
//!
//! When an original program (AFNI, FSL, ANTs, SciPy, fMRIPrep, ...) has a deterministic defect
//! that changes its results, larmorx corrects it by default and says so when it changed a
//! result; a compatibility switch reproduces the original bit for bit. The defects are listed
//! in `docs/findings/upstream-defects.md`, each with an ID (`FSL-01`, `PIPE-03`, ...).
//!
//! - [`UpstreamDefects`] is the switch: [`UpstreamDefects::Fix`] (the default) or
//!   [`UpstreamDefects::Reproduce`]. Every affected tool takes it in its options; on the
//!   command line it comes from the environment variable [`ENV`]
//!   (`LARMORX_UPSTREAM_DEFECTS=fix|reproduce`), so that no flag can clash with the original's
//!   arguments.
//! - [`Defect`] is a register entry; [`DEFECTS`] lists every entry larmorx has a switch for.
//! - [`Notice`] says that a defect changed this result (when fixed) or would have (when
//!   reproduced). Tools return notices; the command lines print [`Notice::line`] on standard
//!   error and the Python wrappers raise `larmorx.UpstreamDefectWarning`.
//!
//! The descriptions of the AFNI and FSL entries describe observable behaviour only, as the
//! register's summary does, so that the clean-room implementations may use them.
