# Next steps

The ordered plan from here: what runs next, what is waiting for the user, and the follow-ups.
Keep it current. The present state is in CLAUDE.md ("Where things are"); the scopes of finished
parts, as they were planned, are in [status-log.md](status-log.md).

**Ground rules.** Port every tool first, then compare with fMRIPrep at the end (user,
2026-10-16): each port is validated against its own original program (parity, golden). **Full
completeness** for every tool: every option, message and failure case, with D13 switches (user,
2026-10-12); brief each agent for it from the start, so a tool takes one pass. **One agent at a
time, in bounded parts with a stop after each**, for the user's usage check (user, 2026-10-10 and
2026-10-17). Every tool's contract includes its figures (CLAUDE.md rule 7). Each merge goes
through CLAUDE.md's checklist. While an agent runs, the orchestrator prepares the next task but
starts no other agent.

## Done since 2026-10-12

| Part | Merged | What | Left over |
|---|---|---|---|
| A4.1 | `c22d336` (10-16) | ITK's HDF5 transform files in pure Rust (`larmorx-hdf5`); `-t x.h5`; h5py dropped | data stored in other files (refused); the writer's fractal-heap indirect blocks (38+ transforms written compactly) |
| A4.2 | `c6fdd61` (10-17) | `antsRegistration`'s linear stages; `antsApplyTransforms`' transform outputs; HDF5 golden fixtures | MINC transform files (the oracle cannot read them either) |
| A4.3 | `084b61d` (10-17) | `antsAI`, `antsAffineInitializer` | `antsAI -b` (blob alignment): its own task, below |
| A4.4 | `f19ffb7` (10-18) | `antsRegistration`'s point-set metrics; ANTS-54 and ITK-21 corrected by default; correctly rounded `pow` | five decisions (below) |
| A5.1 | `7f2a61e` (10-20) | `antsRegistration`'s SyN stages; displacement fields as initial transforms; parity `--jobs` | the other deformable stages (A5.2, A5.3) |
| A5.2 | `a5-part2-bspline` (10-21) | `antsRegistration`'s BSplineSyN, BSpline, GaussianDisplacementField and BSplineDisplacementField stages; the Python API's `mesh_size`, `total_mesh_size`, `spline_order` | `antsApplyTransforms` with `BSplineTransform` files; ANTS-78 and ITK-35 (below); A5.3 |
| Figures 1 | `worktree-agent-a23fe03519502c885` (10-21) | the figure framework (`larmorx_validation.figures`, `docs/figures.md`), 37 figures for every tool ported so far, a page per tool on the site, the landing page's phone layout and Greek glyphs | benchmarks for the pages that say pending; smaller figure files |
| A5.3 | `worktree-agent-aaab33aced8cdf16d` (10-23) | `antsRegistration`'s Exponential, BSplineExponential and time-varying velocity-field stages (every stage ANTs accepts); the corrections ANTS-67/68/70/78 and ITK-24/29/35 by default (and ITK-42); `antsApplyTransforms` with `BSplineTransform` files; both evidence pages | benchmark of the deformable stages; ITK-38 and ITK-40's fix pass on the full tier; MINC transform files |
| A6 | `worktree-agent-a6259dedbd25d703c` (10-22) | `Atropos` to full completeness (every initialisation, likelihood model, posterior formulation, MRF/ICM, outlier and partial-volume option), its evidence page; ITK-50, ITK-51, ANTS-90 to ANTS-107 | ANTS-106 (below) |

## The order from here

1. **Visual reports, part 2: interactive evidence** (user, 2026-10-21; decision log). Part 2a, a
   pilot (merged and approved by the user, 2026-10-21): the Validation guide (method, terms,
   the verdict taxonomy, a tool-by-implementation summary), the shared interactive components
   (image viewer, time series, charts, case explorer, verdict legend) and the pages of
   N4BiasFieldCorrection and 3dTshift. Part 2b: every other tool, and the cases the summary
   counts "within thresholds, not yet classified" (antsApplyTransforms 28, ImageMath 5, ITK
   transform files 1, head-motion correction 121) given their verdicts; N4's benchmark re-run
   against the current oracle (on a quiet machine). **Part 2b merged 2026-10-21:** every tool's
   page in this form, every case classified. Each later part brings its tool's evidence in the
   same form.
2. **A5 part 3: done** (merged 2026-10-23): every `antsRegistration` stage, the corrections of
   2026-10-21, `antsApplyTransforms` with `BSplineTransform` files.
3. **A6, Atropos: done** (merged 2026-10-22, run in parallel with A5 part 3 at the user's
   request). With A4 to A6, sMRIPrep's brain extraction and MNI normalisation run in larmorx
   (A5 part 3 merged).
4. **`antsAI -b`** (blob alignment), its own task (user, 2026-10-17): ANTs' blob detector, patch
   correlations in float, LINPACK's QR and Eigen's vectorised `SelfAdjointEigenSolver`
   (`docs/findings/ants-ai.md`, "Blobs").
5. **AFNI:** 3dUnifize, 3dAutomask (fMRIPrep's BOLD reference enhancement). Checked 2026-10-19:
   current fMRIPrep, niworkflows and sdcflows do not call 3dvolreg (to drop unless wanted);
   optional paths of its libraries use 3dQwarp (sdcflows' alternative PEPOLAR estimator) and
   3dSkullStrip with 3dcalc (niworkflows' legacy AFNI skull-stripping): **planned for later**
   (user, 2026-10-19). Licence per file (`docs/licensing.md`, "Notes checked 2026-10-19"):
   3dUnifize and 3dAutomask may need only one Apache replica. **A later AFNI analysis track
   (decided by the user, 2026-10-19; not fMRIPrep):** 3dTproject, 3dDespike, 3dReHo, 3dRSFC,
   3dDeconvolve/3dREMLfit, 3dFWHMx/3dClustSim, 3dAllineate, 3dcalc, 3dTstat,
   3dROIstats/3dmaskave, 3dresample, 3dvolreg (low priority). Check each source file's licence:
   NIH public-domain files get one Apache replica; MCW (GPL) files a replica in `larmorx-gpl`
   and a clean-room original from a spec.
6. **FSL:** the mcflirt replica, BET, FAST, FLIRT with BBR, topup: a replica in `larmorx-nc` (FSL
   licence, with FSL's source as its terms require) and a clean-room original each.
7. **Field maps, FreeSurfer, surfaces, confounds:** sdcflows' field-map estimation (Apache Python:
   the B-spline fit, PEPOLAR and phase-difference preparation) and fMRIPrep's own Python steps;
   FreeSurfer (`larmorx-freesurfer`: `mri_coreg`, `lta_convert`, then recon-all; its Talairach step
   as a clean-room original with its atlas fetched on first use, its data packaged apart from the
   wheels; `docs/licensing.md`); pretrained models as Rust inference with the original weights
   (decision log 2026-10-19); Connectome Workbench- and MSM-compatible surface tools; the
   confounds (CompCor, DVARS, framewise displacement, ...).
8. **larmorprepx**, then the end-to-end comparison with fMRIPrep.
9. **Releases on PyPI** (below).

## Follow-ups, when they fit

- **Benchmark reports** on a quiet machine: N4 against the new oracle; `antsApplyTransforms`
  after `--float`; the BOLD resampler; SyN (one informal measurement: 96³ CC, ANTs 122 s at one
  thread, larmorx 24 to 41 s, bit-identical); the B-spline and displacement-field stages (4D
  `BSpline` on a small phantom: ANTs 461 s, larmorx 23 s at one thread, identical); HDF5 reading
  against h5py and ANTs; the velocity-field stages; informally, sMRIPrep's registration with
  `BSpline[0.1,26]` (about a million parameters at the last level): ANTs at 4 threads unfinished
  after 3 h 50 min, larmorx 38 s at one thread.
- **Figures:** every new part brings its tool's figures (`docs/figures.md`); the site's pages
  for antsRegistration, antsAI and the HDF5 files say their benchmark is pending until the
  reports above exist. The figures take about 12 MB of the site's repository (four SVGs each,
  text as outlines); embedded font subsets per SVG would make them smaller.
- **Head-motion correction's open cases** (91 of the record's 134, shown as "open" on its
  evidence page): mcflirt's own variability is measured for the real-data cases only; measuring
  its band per option and synthetic case would classify them.
- **Records made with the older CORE-MATH preload** (`ants-image-math`, `ants-n4`, `ants-denoise`,
  ...): re-run; the preload now also replaces `pow`, `powf`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan2` and `cbrt`.
- **ANTS-106 in Atropos** (decided 2026-10-22): partial-volume classes with an MRF, a
  partial-volume label counting as a member of its own set; `reproduce` keeps ANTs' stop; parity
  in `reproduce` plus a fix pass, phantoms with known mixtures, golden case, the site's Atropos
  page. A small part after A5 part 3.
- **In-place writing in 3dTshift** (decided 2026-10-21): an existing writable output in a
  directory that cannot be written is replaced in place, as AFNI does. The replica directly;
  the clean-room original from a spec amendment written from black-box runs (the implementer
  reads only the spec).
- **PIPE-16** (larmorprepx, decided 2026-10-21): the corrected field-map reference keeps N4's
  float32 result; `reproduce` gives fMRIPrep's int16 re-quantisation.
- `larmorx-interp`'s B-spline prefilter still calls the `libm` crate's `pow`: switch to
  `larmorx_core::math::pow` and re-run `antsApplyTransforms`' B-spline cases.
- A4's linear stages run in the global thread pool instead of `n_threads` (results unaffected).
- Coverage: a copy of ds005752 with `IntendedFor` added, so the direct-`fieldmap` path is covered
  (fMRIPrep ignored its field map); ds001600's four field-map N4s.
- Temporary directories `/tmp/lx-ants-inputs-*` and `/tmp/lx-reg-*` left by earlier agents
  (temporary artefacts; may be cleaned).

## Before the first release on PyPI

Checked 2026-10-13: the binaries need no other library than the system's own (on Linux:
`libc`, `libgcc_s`, and for `larmorx-gpl` glibc's `libm`, `libpthread`, `libdl`, `librt`).
Still to do:
- **Windows' C runtime:** nothing sets `+crt-static`, so the `.exe` programs (`larmorx-gpl`,
  the standalone `larmorx`) need `vcruntime140.dll`. Python's own copy serves the extension,
  but a separate program may not find one on a clean Windows. Link the C runtime statically
  for the Windows MSVC targets (`.cargo/config.toml`, both workspaces). CI cannot show the
  problem: GitHub's runners have the runtime installed.
- **Size:** `strip`, LTO and `codegen-units = 1` in the release profile (stripping alone takes
  the extension from 24 to 15 MB).
- **Python dependencies:** h5py dropped (A4 part 1, 2026-10-16: numpy is the only one); check
  that every `[prep]` dependency has wheels for all six platforms, Windows arm64 included. Linux
  wheels are manylinux_2_28 (glibc 2.28 or newer); decide whether to add musllinux wheels
  (Alpine).
- **The `[all]` extra** (decided 2026-10-16): `larmorx-gpl`, `larmorx-nc` and `larmorx-freesurfer`,
  added to `pyproject.toml` once those packages exist (an extra naming a missing package breaks
  `pip install`).
- **Publishing:** a release workflow (on a version tag: the six wheels and the sdist of each
  package, the golden tests, upload by PyPI Trusted Publishing; standalone binaries to GitHub
  Releases); reserve the names `larmorx`, `larmorx-gpl`, `larmorx-nc`, `larmorx-freesurfer`,
  `larmorprepx` (all free on 2026-10-13; needs the user's PyPI account); the licence checks for
  publishing `larmorx-nc` (FSL) and `larmorx-freesurfer` on PyPI; the first release's scope
  (D10) and version numbering.

## Deferred (decide later)

- **Byte-identical deflate in HDF5 files** (decision log, 2026-10-16): larmorx's `.h5` files hold
  the same values as ITK's, but their compressed chunks differ in bytes; porting zlib-ng's
  deflate (one to two days) would make them match the oracle's build only. Skipped for now.

## Waiting for the user

- **Upstream reports:** PIPE-02 and PIPE-03 are drafts in `docs/upstream-reports/`, now with
  PIPE-03's real-data numbers, ready to file (from the user's GitHub account).

Decided 2026-10-22 (decision log): ANTS-106 corrected by default (follow-up below); ANTS-30's
command line approved. Decided 2026-10-21: ANTS-78, ITK-35, ANTS-67, ANTS-68, ANTS-70, ITK-24, ITK-29
corrected by default (with A5 part 3); in-place writing as AFNI does; `LARMORX_GPL_BIN` kept;
PIPE-16 keeps N4's float32 result.
